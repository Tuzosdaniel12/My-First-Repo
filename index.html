        <p>I am a hardworking individual who has for a long time put others first rather than myself.
            Now, is the time that I put myself first and put to work my dreams. 
            I am very eager for this new chapter in my life and for the future.
            My favorite hobbies are videos games, fixing broken electronics, watching sports, and making my yard beautiful.
             I would love to work in a job that can have more flexibility, yet be satisfying to work.
            I always been interested in technology, and I feel coding is a great part of the revolution of this tech era
